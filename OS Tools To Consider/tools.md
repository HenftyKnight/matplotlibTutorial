**R** is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
**R** provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling,
classical statistical tests, time‐series analysis, classification, clustering,
etc.) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.

**Inkscape** is a professional vector graphics editor. It allows you to de‐
sign complex figures and can be used, for example, to improve a script‐
generated figure or to read a PDF file in order to extract figures and trans‐
form them any way you like.

**TikZ** and **PGF** are **TeX packages** for creating graphics programmatically.
TikZ is built on top of PGF and allows you to create sophisticated graph‐
ics in a rather intuitive and easy manner, as shown by the [Tikz gallery](https://texample.net/tikz/examples/all/).

**GIMP** is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is an application for
such tasks as photo retouching, image composition, and image author‐
ing. If you need to quickly retouch an image or add some legends or
labels, GIMP is the perfect tool.

**ImageMagick** is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert
bitmap images from the command line. It can be used to quickly con‐
vert an image into another format, and the huge [script gallery](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/index.php) by Fred
Weinhaus will provide virtually any effect you might want to achieve.

**D3.js** (or just D3 for Data‐Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library that
offers an easy way to create and control interactive data‐based graphical
forms which run in web browsers, as shown in the [gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3) .

**Cytoscape** is a software platform for visualizing complex networks and
integrating these with any type of attribute data. If your data or results
are very complex, cytoscape may help you alleviate this complexity.

**Circos** was originally designed for visualizing genomic data but can cre‐
ate figures from data in any field. Circos is useful if you have data that de‐
scribes relationships or multilayered annotations of one or more scales.
