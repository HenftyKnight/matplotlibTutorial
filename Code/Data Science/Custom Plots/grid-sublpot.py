# Aligned columns or rows of subplots are a common-enoug
# need that Matplotlib has several convenience routines 
# that make them easy to create. The lowest level of these
# is plt.subplot(), which creates a single subplot within 
# grid. As you can see, this command takes three integer 
# argumentsâ€”the number of rows, the number of columns, and 
# the index of the plot to be created in this scheme, which
# runs from the upper left to the bottom right:
