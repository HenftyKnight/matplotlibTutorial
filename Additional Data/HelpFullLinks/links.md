Fonts for you matplotlib graph

Using the fonts in Matplotlib
Once the fonts are installed, you must rebuild the font cache so that it will be available to matplotlib when you make your figure. 
```python
import matplotlib.font_manager as fm # Rebuild the matplotlib font cache
fm._rebuild()
```

Since scientific instrument data is typically fairly simple (usually just one independent variable that we control and a measured, dependent variable), we can use numpy.loadtxt to import our data. For more complicated datasets, I highly recommend using pandas , which has incredibly sophisticated functions for loading and sanitizing data for visualizations â€” a comprehensive documentation can be found on 
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html).
